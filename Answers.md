### 1. What problem does the context API help solve?

When props get passed down, they cant really get passed up unless something such as context is used.

### 1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

store is a global state
actions describe what is going to happen
reducers are the logic to it all

### 1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?

Component state is within the editor. Application comes in from an outside source.

### 1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.

### 1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

Context, it feels like a simpler version of what needs to be done.
